# Image-Similarity-Search

The project aimed to classify and find similarities between images of dogs and cats using deep learning techniques. The process involved training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model on a dataset of dog and cat images, extracting features from the trained model, and using these features to find similar images. We also used Google Drive for storing the trained model and features CSV file. This allows for the reuse of the pretrained model and features without rerunning the entire training process
